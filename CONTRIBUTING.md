Contributing to Project Alhvynkaris should be relatively easy and simple, so long as it doesn't make any plot holes nor add major mechanics...

Mainly, you must review and align your document to the `/Meta/Style Guide.md/` and `/Meta/Structure Guide.md/`, and that should fix up most problems. Don't mess with Obsidian settings (or do so, but not commit your settings), particularly with `/.obsidian/workspaces.json/`.

As a quick reminder, we are not using strict markdown line breaks, as this is meant to be read on Obsidian. Regardless, format your documents to use a blank line between paragraphs, as per [Obsidian's default](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Line+breaks) and for readability as plain text. Use [Obsidian flavored markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/obsidian-flavored-markdown) as well.

For commiting, make your own branch under your OWN username, then any flavor text. I.e. & e.g.;

<**username**> <*flavor text*>

**Wilt-r's** *Stable Branch*

*then*, commit to the `nightly` branch. We use a semantic versioning system based versioning system:

a.b.c.d.e

`a` being a major release.
`b` being a minor release.
`c` being a patch.
`d` being a hotfix.
`e` being of your own choosing.

Increment `e` in your own branch however you like, then you can pull request to the `nightly` branch as one of the daily hotfixes. When there is a meaningful amount of content in multiple hotfixes, they are pushed to the `main` branch as a patch. Patches add up to minor and then major releases. The ideal flow of a major release is to be at least every half year.

When pulling, as stated earlier, it should be painless for little things, less so the bigger it is. Whatever its related to, the whole team for it must approve of it (TBD).

thank you so, so much for contributing! Seriously. THANK YOU!!!
