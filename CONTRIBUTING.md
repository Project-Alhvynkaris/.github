Contributing to Project Alhvynkaris should be relatively easy and simple, so long as it doesn't make any plot holes.

Mainly, you must review and align your document to the `Style Guide.md` and `Structure Guide.md`, and that should fix up most problems. Don't mess with Obsidian settings (or do so, but not commit your settings).

As a quick reminder, we are not using strict markdown line breaks, as this is meant to be read on Obsidian. Regardless, format your documents to use a blank line between paragraphs, as per [Obsidian's default](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Line+breaks) and for readability as plain text.

Thank you so much for contributing!
