There shouldn't be any security flaws in... a text based wiki, but if you do find things, please DM `Wilt-r` or others in the moderation team about it.

Alert us about things like;
 - Locational or other identifying (beyond benign username, time, etc) metadata in an asset file causing a doxxing threat for a writer.
 - Image-borne malware.
 - Malicious changes to the `.obsidian` config.

Thank you for your services to the security and safety of Project Alhvynkaris.
